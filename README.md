# Vending Machine Pillar Kata

1) Make sure you have Maven installed and that you can use it within your terminal or command line.

2) Open up your terminal or command line.

3) Change the directory in your terminal or command line to the root folder of the project. There should be a pom file in the same directory you are in.

4) You can build the project by running the following command without the quotes within the project folder:
	"mvn package"

5) You can run the tests I created by running the following command without the quotes:
	"mvn test"
